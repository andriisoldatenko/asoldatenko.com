Abstract
--------

We live in changeable world, and our applications are also very inconstant. As a result we have to know how to improve project quality. The subject of my presentation is related to the modern approaches of designing and implementing automated functional tests, by using, for instance, design patterns, improving test execution time based parallel execution, scaling by distributing tests on several machines, creating strategy for generation of big sets of test data and setup skeleton for organizing tests for typical Django project. I am pleased to share with you my acquired experience in this field.
