Abstract
--------

Nowadays we can see lot’s of benchmarks and performance tests of
different web frameworks and Python tools. Regarding to search engines,
it’s difficult to find useful information especially benchmarks or comparing
between different search engines. It’s difficult to manage what search
engine you should select for instance, ElasticSearch, Postgres Full Text
Search or may be Sphinx or Whoosh. You face a difficult choice, that’s why
I am pleased to share with you my acquired experience and benchmarks
and focus on how to compare full text search engines for Python.
