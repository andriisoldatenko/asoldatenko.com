Abstract
--------
There are a lot of books and publications about the continuous integration
in the world. But in my experience itâ€™s difficult to find information about how
to open quality gates between automated tests and to continuous integration
practice to in your current project. After reading several articles and even a
couple of books you will understand how to work with it. But what next? I will
share with you practical tips and tricks on how to lift iron curtain to your
automated tests before a continuous quality practice today. It is for this
reason why I am pleased to share with you my acquired experience in my
presentation.
