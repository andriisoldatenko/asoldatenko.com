Introduction
------------
Nowadays we can see lot’s of benchmarks and performance tests of different
web frameworks and Python tools. Regarding to search engines, it’s difficult
to find useful information especially benchmarks or comparing between
different search engines. It’s difficult to manage what search engine you
should select for instance, ElasticSearch, Postgres Full Text Search or may
be Sphinx or Whoosh. You face a difficult choice, that’s why I am pleased to
share with you my acquired experience and benchmarks and focus on how to
compare full text search engines for Python.
