Introduction
------------
Social phenomena is coming. We have lot’s of social applications that we
are using every day, let’s say `Facebook`_, `twitter`_, `instagram`_.
Lot’s of such kind apps based on social graph and graph theory.
I would like to share my knowledge and expertise about how to work with graphs
and build large social graph as engine for Social network using python
and Graph databases. We'll compare SQL and NoSQL approaches for friends
relationships.
