##Subject
High performance functional tests based on Selenium

##Abstract
“Time is at once the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions”. Correspondingly we must know how to improve a quality of the project in the limitted timeframes. The goal of my presentation is improving an execution time of automated functional tests based on Selenium Webdriver, by using, for instance, parallel execution, scaling by distributing tests on several machines, creating strategy for generation of big sets of test data for typical project. I am pleased to share with you my acquired experience in this field.
